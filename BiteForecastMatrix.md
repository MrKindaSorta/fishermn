Weather-Based Bite Score System for Ice Fishing (0–100 Scale)
This system assigns an hourly “bite score” from 0 (terrible) to 100 (excellent) for each fish species, using a baseline of 50 for normal conditions. We then adjust that score based on various weather factors and events. The goal is to incorporate as much meteorological data as possible – temperature trends, barometric pressure changes, cloud cover, etc. – and weight each factor according to how it influences fish activity in winter (ice fishing season). Each species’ unique behavior patterns are considered so the forecast can be tailored to specific fish species in Minnesota’s winter conditions. Below is a plain-English, step-by-step outline of the scoring logic, including factor weightings, thresholds for good/fair/poor conditions, time-of-day modifiers, and how to combine everything into a final bite score.
Key Factors and Their Weightings
Each weather factor is evaluated and given a score adjustment. Positive adjustments (+) mean better feeding conditions (score above 50), and negative adjustments (–) mean worse conditions (score below 50). We’ll start from the baseline 50 and add or subtract points for each factor:

1. Barometric Pressure Trends
   Why it matters: Fish under ice respond strongly to changes in atmospheric pressure. A falling barometer often triggers feeding, while a high or sharply rising barometer can shut down the bite
   midwestoutdoors.com
   kestrelinstruments.com
   . Rapid pressure shifts make fish uncomfortable by affecting their swim bladder and buoyancy, even under ice
   midwestoutdoors.com
   midwestoutdoors.com
   .
   Falling Pressure (Good): If pressure is dropping significantly (e.g. a drop of ≥ ~1.5–2 mb in 3 hours, or a steady downward trend over several hours), fish tend to become more active and feed. Add ~+10 to +15 points during periods of falling pressure
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   fishusa.com
   . The bite often peaks just before a storm/front arrives when the barometer is in decline (an “approaching low” event).
   Threshold: For example, a drop of ~0.05–0.06 inches of Hg (1.5–2.0 mb) over a few hours could trigger a “falling pressure” boost.
   Low or Low-Steady Pressure (Good): If pressure is low and steady (e.g. around or below the average ~29.7–30.0 inches Hg, or <1010 hPa, and not rising), conditions are generally favorable. Fish are comfortable and likely to feed normally or better than normal
   kestrelinstruments.com
   kestrelinstruments.com
   . Add ~+5 (a mild bonus) for consistently low pressure. Example: During a prolonged low-pressure system (cloudy, mild weather), expect above-average bite activity.
   Stable Pressure (Neutral to Fair): If pressure is stable (little change, ±0.5 mb or less over 3+ hours), fish behavior normalizes. After fish have acclimated to a stable high or stable normal pressure for a day or more, they resume routine feeding
   in-depthoutdoors.com
   . In this case, add 0 (keep baseline) or at most a slight +5 if conditions have been stable and fair for >24 hours. Consistency is key: stable conditions over 2–3 days can actually lead to a prolonged decent bite once fish adjust
   in-depthoutdoors.com
   .
   Rising Pressure (Poor): If pressure is increasing (e.g. +1–2 mb in a few hours, such as right after a cold front passes), fish often become lethargic and the bite drops off
   in-depthoutdoors.com
   midwestoutdoors.com
   . Subtract ~–10 points during a sharp rise. A rapid pressure jump (storm departing) can cause a major short-term feeding lull, often lasting 12–24 hours until fish acclimate
   midwestoutdoors.com
   . The bite often shuts down right after a storm until conditions stabilize.
   High Pressure Extremes (Very Poor): If pressure is very high (e.g. ≥30.50 inches Hg / ~1033+ hPa, often accompanied by cold, clear weather), many species’ appetites are suppressed
   kestrelinstruments.com
   . In such cases, subtract an additional –5 to –10. Fish can feel the heavy “weight” of the atmosphere pressing down, making them uncomfortable and unlikely to feed
   midwestoutdoors.com
   kestrelinstruments.com
   . For instance, a frigid high-pressure dome right after a front might drive the score down significantly (fish may “lockjaw” for a day or so).
   Summary: Falling or low pressure = good (boost the score); rising or high pressure = bad (lower the score). We define thresholds so that even a minor barometer change can be factored in, but only significant swings get the largest adjustments. This ensures small forecast fluctuations won’t wildly swing the bite score while truly important pressure events still have a strong influence.
2. Temperature \& Cold Fronts
   Why it matters: Fish are cold-blooded, so water temperature and air temperature trends (which affect the water under ice gradually) influence their metabolism. In winter, extreme cold can slow fish activity to a crawl
   kestrelinstruments.com
   , whereas a mild warming trend can spur a bit more feeding. We also consider sudden temperature changes (cold fronts or warm fronts) as events.
   Extreme Cold (Poor): If air temps are extremely low (e.g. single digits °F or below 0°F / < –18°C), expect very sluggish fish
   kestrelinstruments.com
   . During severe cold snaps (especially if recent), subtract –10 or so from the score. Fish metabolism is greatly reduced, they digest slowly, and they feed much less in bitter cold
   midwestoutdoors.com
   kestrelinstruments.com
   . Threshold: We might define “extreme cold” as daily highs below ~10°F (–12°C) or a sudden drop of >15°F from the previous day’s highs – indicate a strong cold front.
   Cold Front Arrival (Poor Event): A fast temperature drop (often tied with rising pressure) is a classic bad event. Fish often feed briefly just before the front hits (when pressure falls), then shut down once the cold/high pressure settles in
   in-depthoutdoors.com
   . So, for a cold front event: boost scores in the hours leading up to the front (as covered under falling pressure), then once the cold air arrives, apply a significant –10 to –15 penalty for the next 12–24 hours. This represents the post-front “lockjaw” period
   midwestoutdoors.com
   .
   Mild Temperatures (Good): If winter air temps are moderate (15–32°F) for the season, or there’s a slight warming trend, fish are somewhat more comfortable. Add +5 for a warming trend or unseasonably mild day. For example, after a deep freeze, a day that climbs into the 20s°F or a sunny 32°F afternoon can spur a bit more activity as fish might move shallower for the relative warmth. Breaks in frigid weather improve odds of fish feeding
   kestrelinstruments.com
   .
   Warming Trend (Good Event): A gradual rise in temperature over a couple of days (especially if approaching the freezing point or above) is a positive event. Fish that were lethargic may start to feed more regularly. Apply a small +5 to +10 spread over the period of warming. This is especially helpful for species like bass that respond to slightly warmer water by becoming more active
   wired2fish.com
   .
   Stable Average Cold (Neutral): If temperatures are steady and typical for winter (e.g. hovering around 20°F consistently each day with no big swings), then temperature isn’t a major factor – no adjustment or a neutral baseline. Fish will be in their normal winter pattern (slow but steady bite during usual peak times).
   Note: Because water under ice changes temperature slowly, we mainly use air temp trends as indicators of fronts and overall conditions. Also, extreme wind chills (though fish don’t feel wind, it indicates bitter cold) can reinforce that extreme cold penalty. But a slight day-to-day temp change (say 2–3°F) should not impact score much – we focus on significant warming or cooling events to avoid overreacting to minor forecast fluctuations.
3. Cloud Cover \& Light Penetration
   Why it matters: Light conditions under the ice are crucial. Many game fish feed more in low-light conditions (dawn, dusk, cloudy days) because it gives them a hunting advantage
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   . Cloud cover dictates how much light penetrates the ice and snow. In winter, overcast skies often improve mid-day fishing for light-sensitive predators by extending their feeding window
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   fishusa.com
   . Conversely, bright sun on clear ice can sometimes spook fish or push them deeper.
   Overcast Skies (Generally Good): High cloud cover (e.g. 70–100% cloudiness) means less light gets through the ice. Treat heavy clouds as a positive for species that prefer dim conditions. During daylight hours, add ~+5 (or reduce any midday penalty) for low-light-loving fish like walleye, muskie, crappie, etc. Under a heavy overcast, fish like walleye may stay active longer into the day (similar to dawn/dusk conditions)
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   . Example: A fully cloudy afternoon might fish like an extended dusk – predators remain on the prowl, so bump their scores up a bit then.
   Clear Skies (Mixed Effect): Low cloud cover (clear, 0–20%) means bright sun, especially if there’s little snow on the ice. For species sensitive to bright light (walleye, crappie, trout in shallow clear water), subtract a few points (–5) during mid-day hours under clear skies
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   . Bright conditions often push these fish deeper or make them wary, so the bite is poorer at high noon. However, clear skies at night allow moonlight – which could slightly help nocturnal feeders (though we’re not explicitly calculating moon phase here). Overall, treat clear, sunny midday as a minor negative for low-light feeders, but for sight-feeding panfish (bluegill, perch) bright sun can be neutral or even slightly positive, since they rely on vision to feed on plankton/insects. Balance: We might apply a –5 for predators on sunny noon, and 0 or +2 for panfish on the same sunny noon (they often bite well on sunny winter days in mid-afternoon).
   Partly Cloudy (Neutral): Moderate cloud cover (~30–70%) likely has minimal net effect. There’s enough light for sight feeders and enough cover for predators. No major score change unless combined with time-of-day (e.g. partly cloudy at dusk is still dusk – fish will bite).
   Snow Cover on Ice: (This is an indirect factor related to light.) If the lake has deep snowpack on the ice, light penetration is already low. In that case, an additional cloud cover might make it too dark for some species to find food easily, possibly slowing the bite midday
   in-depthoutdoors.com
   . But if ice is clear or lightly snow-covered, clouds help by reducing light. We can’t get snow-on-ice from the weather API, but as a note: heavy snow cover (over weeks) can also lower oxygen in water, slowing fish metabolism
   midwestoutdoors.com
   , but that is beyond direct hourly weather data. We assume typical mid-winter conditions and focus on cloud cover’s immediate effect.
   In summary: Cloudy/overcast = generally better daytime fishing (add points for predators, extend their feeding periods)
   fishusa.com
   . Sunny/bright = tougher for low-light hunters at midday (subtract points for those species)
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   , though it may not hurt panfish as much. Always consider cloud cover in tandem with time-of-day and species (detailed below).
4. Precipitation \& Storm Events (Snow/Rain)
   Why it matters: Precipitation (snow in winter, sometimes freezing rain) often coincides with major pressure changes and fronts. Fish often sense an oncoming storm and feed heavily before and during the early phase of that event
   fishusa.com
   . Precip events also alter light (snow can darken the sky/water) and in open water can oxygenate or muddy water, but under ice, snowfall mainly affects light and maybe sound. We use precipitation probability and intensity to time these “event” adjustments.
   Approaching Precipitation (Pre-Storm Feeding Frenzy): If the forecast shows high precipitation probability (POP) and falling pressure in the next few hours, that indicates an approaching storm (snowstorm or system). Typically, 3–6 hours before a major snow is when fish might go on a bite spree
   fishusa.com
   . We should add +10 (significant boost) in the few hours leading up to the onset of a big snow or storm front. Essentially, when POP is rising toward >50% and pressure is dropping, start ramping up the bite score. For example, if heavy snow is forecast around 6 PM, expect great fishing mid-afternoon through early evening before the storm fully hits. This ties in with the falling pressure bonus – we ensure the score reflects that combination of cues (fish “know” weather is changing and often feed intensely before the storm).
   Light Precipitation (Neutral/Slight Positive): Light snow or flurries during otherwise calm conditions usually has little negative effect on fish. In fact, a gentle snowfall can subtly improve fishing: it keeps skies cloudy (low light) and the falling snow makes less noise than rain would. You might add a small +2 if light snow is occurring, especially for species that like low light. Light precipitation also tends to keep anglers away, but since we are focusing on fish, we note it doesn’t bother them much
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   . We won’t penalize for a light snow or very light mixed precipitation.
   Heavy Snow/Blizzard Conditions (Mixed): During the height of a major snowfall or blizzard, conditions can be chaotic: barometer at its lowest, winds high, possibly reduced oxygen exchange if it’s prolonged, etc. Fish may have fed actively at the onset, but during the peak of a heavy storm, some species might hunker down (especially if there’s howling wind causing vibration on the ice). We might keep scores elevated at the beginning of a storm (fish often still biting as it starts), but if a blizzard persists for hours, consider a small penalty (–5) during the worst of it to reflect any mid-storm slowdown. (This is a cautious adjustment; data on under-ice feeding during a blizzard is sparse, but heavy snowfall could be akin to heavy rain in open water – initially good, but too much turbulence can eventually hinder feeding
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   .) In any case, the big drop usually comes after the storm passes.
   Post-Storm High Pressure (Very Poor): Once the snowfall stops and skies clear (pressure starts rising fast), we impose the largest negative adjustment. As noted earlier, after a storm front passes, fish often go almost dormant for a day
   midwestoutdoors.com
   . So in the 6–24 hours after a major precip event ends, subtract –15 (or whatever keeps the score very low). This overlaps with the “rising pressure” penalty, essentially doubling down to mark that period as an extremely poor bite window. For instance, the morning after a blizzard with bluebird skies and high pressure would likely score near 0–20 (very poor) for most species – a classic “bluebird sky after storm” shutdown.
   Rain/Freezing Rain: Rain is rare in deep winter, but if it occurs (maybe early or late winter), treat it similarly. Light rain can be okay or even stir a bite, while a heavy rainstorm (with falling pressure) could trigger feeding before it, but heavy rain itself might not be relevant under ice (except noise). In open-water season we’d consider rain impact on water clarity, but under ice, heavy rain could melt surface snow and add cold runoff – likely negative for fish. For simplicity: treat any precip type similarly through winter: it’s more about the associated pressure changes and light levels than the precipitation itself.
   Precipitation Volume: The API may give snow volume (e.g. mm per 3h). We can use this to gauge light vs heavy snow. Threshold: e.g. <1 mm/3h = very light snow (no score change), 1–5 mm = moderate snow (slight + early on), >5 mm in 3h = heavy snow (front coming or overhead – big pre-boost, then slight mid-storm dip as discussed). If rain volume appears (likely 0 in ice season, except maybe sleet), handle similarly.
   In short, incorporate precipitation events as triggers: boost before they start, watch for possible minor dip during extreme conditions, and penalize heavily right after they end. Use POP and forecast data to identify these windows in the 5-day outlook, so we can anticipate bite changes a day or two ahead (e.g. “storm coming in 36 hours, so tomorrow evening’s bite might ramp up”).
5. Wind and Wind Gusts
   Why it matters: Wind affects fish behavior more in open water (waves oxygenate water, push food around) than under solid ice. However, wind is still a sign of weather changes and can create noise/vibrations that fish detect through the ice. We primarily use wind as a supporting indicator for storm severity and frontal activity rather than a direct factor.
   Strong Winds (Storm Indicator): If wind speeds or gusts are very high (e.g. >20–30 mph), it usually means a strong weather system is in play (likely corresponding to the pressure changes we already account for). High wind by itself under ice could slightly spook fish due to the sound of ice flexing or snow blowing. During periods of extreme gusts (especially if >30–40 mph gusts on the forecast), we can apply a minor –5 to reflect potential fish wariness. This mostly overlaps with heavy snow/blizzard scenarios (blizzards = high wind + snow). Essentially, use wind/gust as an additional modifier for storm intensity: a fierce blizzard with 40 mph gusts might get a slightly bigger mid-storm penalty than a calm gentle snowfall.
   Moderate Breeze (Neutral/Minor): Winds in the 5–15 mph range under normal conditions likely have no noticeable effect on fish under a thick ice sheet – no score change. If anything, a light breeze on a sunny day might prevent too much surface calm (which under ice is not too relevant). We don’t over-complicate this: moderate winds are neutral.
   Calm, High-Pressure Days: Not really about wind, but note that often a calm wind goes with high pressure blue-sky days – which we already marked as poor via pressure/sunlight factors. We don’t double-penalize calm wind (calm itself isn’t bad; it’s the high pressure usually accompanying it that’s bad). In fact, calm conditions after a couple days might help fish settle back (but that is captured by “stable conditions” logic).
   In summary, weigh wind lightly: it’s mostly an indicator of storms. We ensure that a major wind event is captured as part of a storm’s effect. Otherwise, we avoid giving wind too much weight since it could cause unnecessary fluctuation and is partially redundant with pressure/precip data. (Note: In open water forecasts, wind direction and speed would matter for drifting, mixing, etc., but under ice its role is minimal beyond indicating storms.)
6. Other Available Factors
   We have a few other fields from the weather data. These generally play a smaller role but are noted for completeness:
   Humidity: High humidity often precedes precipitation (damp, low-pressure air) and low humidity comes with clear high-pressure air. We won’t score humidity directly, but it correlates with factors we already use. For instance, if humidity is very low (dry, clear cold air), it likely confirms a high-pressure situation – which we’ve penalized. If humidity is high (near 100%), it implies clouds/rain – which we’ve likely rewarded (before storms). So we won’t double-count humidity; just be aware it aligns with the conditions we’re handling.
   Visibility: Low visibility in the weather report usually means fog, heavy snow, or blowing snow. In winter, fog or blowing snow could indicate a moisture-rich system or blizzard. If we detect very low visibility (<1 mile) and high humidity, that could reinforce that a storm is ongoing – by then we’ve already accounted for storm effects via pressure/precip. Under the ice, water visibility can affect fishing, but atmospheric visibility is not directly telling us underwater clarity (except perhaps heavy snow might reduce light penetration). We generally skip using this directly in the score.
   Sunrise/Sunset Times: These are critical for timing the “golden hours” of fishing. We use sunrise/sunset to schedule daily bite multipliers (covered in the next section). Ensure to use the lake’s local time zone and coordinates (which we have) for accurate dawn/dusk times each day. This isn’t a “weather condition” but a daily astronomical event used in our model.
   Moon Phase (Not in API): We’re not explicitly using moon phase in this iteration since it’s not provided by the current data, but note that moonlight can slightly influence night feeding (a full moon night might extend feeding a bit for nocturnal feeders). For now, we assume average conditions or incorporate any effect implicitly via cloud cover (e.g. cloudy nights = darker). A future enhancement could include lunar phase for fine-tuning night scores.
   Time-of-Day Multipliers (Daily Feeding Rhythm)
   Time of day is a huge factor in fish feeding, especially in winter. Most species have prime feeding windows around sunrise and sunset (the “golden hours”), with secondary patterns during day or night depending on species
   fishusa.com
   fishusa.com
   . We incorporate this by applying hourly multipliers or point adjustments based on the relationship to sunrise/sunset and the species’ known behavior. This ensures our forecast is per-hour specific with maximum specificity.
7. Defining Golden Hours and Night/Day
   Using sunrise and sunset times for each day (which vary by date and location), we define:
   Dawn/Dusk Windows: Approximately 90 minutes around sunrise and 90 minutes around sunset are high-activity periods for many fish
   fishusa.com
   fishusa.com
   . We can define a window (e.g. 1.5 hours before and after the official sunrise/sunset times, or 45 min before to 45 min after, depending on how precise we want) as the “peak feeding window” for crepuscular (twilight-active) species.
   Daytime vs Night: For our purposes:
   “Day” = from after sunrise window until before sunset window.
   “Night” = the period after dusk until before the next dawn window (full darkness).
   We then apply species-specific multipliers to the baseline score during these periods:
8. Species-Specific Feeding Pattern Adjustments
   Each of the top 20 Minnesota species will have its own profile for when it tends to feed. We start with a base pattern (most fish: best at dawn/dusk, slower mid-day, some feed at night) and then tweak per species. These time-of-day adjustments will stack with the weather factors above. Below are the species-specific behaviors and how we adjust scores for time of day (and any special sensitivities):
   Walleye: Low-light predator. Walleye are notorious for excellent vision in low light, so dawn and dusk are peak times
   fishusa.com
   – give a strong boost here (e.g. +15 points during those 90-minute windows). They also feed after dark; nights can remain good (say +5 to +10 at night, especially the first few hours of darkness)
   fishusa.com
   . Midday (bright sun) is typically slow for walleye – apply a penalty then (e.g. –10 around the brightest mid-day hours)
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   . Overcast weather will mitigate the midday slump (we handle that via cloud cover as noted). So effectively, walleye hourly multiplier might look like: Dawn ~1.3×, Day ~0.8× (lower the score), Dusk ~1.3×, Early Night ~1.2×, Late Night ~1.0× (they can feed at night, but often the first part of night is best). Walleye also get strong weather-factor sensitivity: they respond a lot to pressure changes (falling pressure event = big boost for walleye bite)
   huntandfishsquawlake.com
   .
   Northern Pike: Diurnal ambush predator. Pike are active throughout the day (they have good vision and will hunt in daylight more than walleye do), but still see increased action at dawn and dusk
   fishusa.com
   . For pike, we give a moderate boost at dawn/dusk (+10 points), but unlike walleye, we don’t penalize midday as much. They can and do feed under bright conditions, especially if they have cover or if the water is stained. On overcast days, pike might bite steadily all day
   fishusa.com
   , whereas on clear days they might linger deeper midday. At night, pike activity drops (they’re not known for night feeding in winter), so we’d reduce scores at night (maybe –5 to –10 at night, effectively near 0 for late-night). Pike also react to weather events: they often go on the bite before a storm like other predators, and high pressure cold fronts can slow them too, but perhaps slightly less finicky than walleye. Weight pressure and fronts for pike, but time-of-day is a bit more forgiving (midday isn’t zero for pike; it’s just “okay” especially if other factors are good).
   Muskellunge (Muskie): Big predator, generally sluggish in winter. Ice fishing for muskie is rare (they are typically a summer/fall target), but if included, their pattern is similar to pike’s, with even more focus on low-light. Dawn/dusk would be the only realistic windows to see any activity (+10 or so). Midday for muskies under ice is usually very slow (they often just suspend and barely move in cold water). Possibly penalize midday (–10) strongly. Night: muskies can feed at night in summer; under ice, it’s uncommon to target them, but if one were active it might be during the evening. We can keep night very low probability (score near 0) for muskies in winter. Essentially, muskie bite scores will seldom be high in winter except maybe the odd evening with perfect conditions (e.g. a dusk period during a falling pressure event might be the best chance). They also are affected by pressure like pike/walleye (predator with swim bladder) – likely a falling pressure dusk could be when a muskie might actually bite if at all.
   Largemouth Bass: Cold-slowed, prefers warmer part of day. Bass have a much slower metabolism in winter
   wired2fish.com
   . They still feed, but infrequently. They often choose times when they can see and when water might be marginally warmer – that tends to be during daylight, especially afternoon if the sun warms shallow water a bit
   wired2fish.com
   . So, for largemouth under ice:
   Midday/Afternoon (11am–3pm): this can actually be a relative peak (unlike walleye). If there’s sun or a warm trend, bass might feed during early afternoon. Give a small boost midday (+5) on days that aren’t frigid.
   Dawn: They may feed at first light too, but cold mornings can make them sluggish. Perhaps a mild +5 at dawn.
   Dusk: Similar to dawn, a small boost if they feed, but not as pronounced as walleye. Bass often get more active just before dark in many seasons, so +5 near sunset.
   Night: Largemouth bass are not active at night in cold water (virtually zero night bite in winter). We’d significantly drop the score at night (–15 or effectively set to a minimum) for bass.
   Also weight weather: bass will be heavily influenced by temperature trends. A warm front can really help them (they might actually bite during that warm spell), whereas a severe cold front might nearly shut them down entirely for days. So, factor temperature changes strongly for bass. Pressure changes matter less than temperature for them (they’re often hunkered down and won’t move much no matter what, unless temps improve).
   Smallmouth Bass: More cold-tolerant than largemouth, often deep. Smallmouth in winter often occupy deeper water near rocks. They can be slightly more active in cold water than largemouth. Their feeding windows may be similar: afternoon slight warmth and low-light times around dawn/dusk can produce bites. We can treat their time-of-day weighting similarly to largemouth, but perhaps give a little more credit to dawn/dusk than largemouth get. (Smallmouth might chase baitfish at first light even in cold water.) So:
   Dawn/Dusk: moderate +5 to +10 each.
   Midday: still could be okay, +5 if conditions are sunny (they might enjoy a bit of warmth on rocks).
   Night: basically zero (no night bite for bass).
   Weather-wise, smallmouth also respond to warm trends (they’ll feed more if there’s a stable warm period). They do have swim bladders, so pressure might affect them some, but their winter behavior is mostly sticking to structure and feeding rarely unless conditions are favorable.
   Yellow Perch: Daytime schoolers. Perch feed in schools and rely on sight to pick off small prey. They bite best during daylight, often with peaks in morning and late afternoon, and can continue feeding through midday if conditions allow. They typically slow down at night (though very occasionally a night bite happens, perch are mostly inactive in darkness). So:
   Morning: Strong bite in the first few hours after sunrise (perch often feed in early morning) – +10 during mid-morning
   fishusa.com
   .
   Afternoon: Another good period is late afternoon towards sunset – +10 leading into sunset.
   Midday: Perch can still be caught at midday, especially if it’s cloudy (so not too bright) or if they’re on a mud flat eating larvae. We might leave midday as baseline or slight + (0 to +5) if other factors are good. If it’s a bright high-pressure day, midday perch might slow a bit (we’d handle that with clear sky penalty for sight predators – perch might be slightly uncomfortable in super bright clear ice conditions, but less so than walleye).
   Night: Very low. Subtract a lot (–20) to effectively zero out nighttime score for perch. They don’t have the vision for night feeding (exception: some lakes people catch perch after dark under lights, but generally, not significant).
   Weather: Perch like stable weather. A big cold front really shuts down jumbo perch (they may switch to tiny food and ignore lures)
   in-depthoutdoors.com
   . So pressure rising/cold front = big negative for perch. Falling pressure/clouds = good, they’ll roam and bite more aggressively. Not as extremely sensitive as walleye, but still significant.
   Black Crappie / White Crappie: Crepuscular and nocturnal panfish. Crappies are famous for the evening and nighttime bite through the ice. They often start biting at dusk and continue well after dark
   fishusa.com
   . They also feed at dawn, and if it’s cloudy they can feed sporadically all day as well
   fishusa.com
   . Our adjustments:
   Sunset into Night: This is prime. Big boost at dusk (+15) and keep scores high through the evening hours (+10 during night up to a point). Many anglers fish crappie from dusk through late night because crappie continue feeding on minnows and plankton in darkness. We’ll reflect that with sustained higher scores at night for crappie (e.g. 7pm, 9pm could still be good scores).
   Dawn: Also a good time (though evening is usually better). Give a +10 at dawn for crappie.
   Daytime: Crappie can be hit-or-miss during mid-day. On overcast days, they might roam and bite intermittently even at noon (so if cloudy, we might not penalize midday much). On bright days, they tend to suspend in deeper water and not bite until light fades. So base midday is maybe –5 for crappie (fair at best), but that will be offset to neutral if clouds (because we add points for overcast).
   Weather: Crappie, being panfish, might not be as dramatically affected by pressure as walleye, but they do respond. A falling barometer pre-storm will get them feeding (especially if it coincides with evening – you can have a fantastic crappie bite just before a snowstorm at dusk). High pressure cold bluebird day might make the crappie bite finicky except maybe at nightfall. We weight these accordingly (not quite as heavily as walleye, but definitely noticeable).
   Bluegill \& Pumpkinseed Sunfish: Mid-day feeders, visual hunters of small prey. Bluegills and pumpkinseeds often feed during daylight hours and are less active at dawn/dusk than many other fish. In winter, they might actually prefer late morning through afternoon when there’s some light and slightly warmer shallow water (especially late ice). They generally do not feed at night. So:
   Midday/Afternoon: This is the best time for sunfish. Give a +10 around late morning to early afternoon for bluegill/pumpkinseed. Many ice anglers find late morning (10am–2pm) to be good for bluegills in mid-winter, particularly if the sun is out a bit (it can warm shallow areas a tad or at least let them see food). In fact, “warm, sunny days” can be good panfish days

   .
   Dawn: Early morning can be okay but not peak; maybe a small +5 at sunrise.
   Dusk: Sunfish often actually slow down at dusk (opposite of crappie). As light fades, they often stop feeding and settle in vegetation. So we might drop the score in the evening (0 or –5 during what is dusk for others). Essentially, bluegill bite often dies off by sunset.
   Night: Essentially 0 – subtract a big amount. Bluegill and pumpkinseed do not feed at night under ice; they become inactive.
   Weather: Sunfish are less sensitive to barometer than predators; they’re more about comfort and food availability. Extremely high pressure and cold might still slow them (they become lethargic), so we do apply some penalty in severe cold/high pressure scenarios. But they’ll still nibble at something small even on tough days, just not as actively. Cloud cover’s effect: sunfish might actually feed better with some sun (contrary to walleye). However, if no snow is on ice and it’s super bright, they can get spooky too. We’ll not complicate too much: assume they’re generally fine in daylight regardless of clouds, and not feeding in dark. So we already handle that by giving them midday preference and no night score.
   Lake Trout: Active predator, even in cold, often day-long feeder. Lake trout (found in deeper colder lakes) remain relatively active in winter, patrolling for ciscoes or smelt. They can be caught all day long, with perhaps slight peaks at low-light times. Adjustments:
   Daytime (Late Morning/Afternoon): Lake trout often have a strong midday bite window. Unlike walleye, they’re not as light-shy (especially in deep water where they often roam). We might actually give +5 in late morning through early afternoon for lake trout, reflecting that they often feed when the sun is highest – this light can help them see prey in deep water.
   Dawn/Dusk: Still important – lakers will also feed at dawn and dusk near baitfish schools. So +5 to +10 at dawn and +5 to +10 at dusk.
   Night: Some trout species do feed at night (browns, rainbows occasionally), but lake trout are less active at night; they typically go deeper and rest. We’d drop lake trout scores at night (maybe down to –10 or so at night, essentially poor).
   Weather: Lake trout might not be as affected by barometric pressure as species with large swim bladders near the surface, since they often stay deep. But they do have swim bladders, so sudden pressure changes could still affect them somewhat. They are also often in lakes that stratify (but in winter, lakes are uniform cold). We’ll include pressure and fronts for them but perhaps weight slightly less than walleye. Cloud cover likely matters less for lakers because they live in dim deep water anyway (though on clear shallow flats it might). So we won’t give as much of a cloud penalty or bonus for lakers – they can hunt in bright light 50 feet down just fine.
   Rainbow Trout / Brown Trout / Brook Trout: Trout species (shallow water types). These trout, often stocked in small lakes or present in streams (where applicable under ice), can be active under ice but have some distinct patterns:
   Brook \& Rainbow Trout: Often cruise near shallow areas early and late in the day. Morning and evening can be best (similar to other fish) – give +10 dawn, +10 dusk. They also can feed during the daytime if conditions are right (rainbows especially will bite mid-morning). We might keep a moderate baseline through day (0 to +5 midday). Night: Trout generally reduce feeding at night under ice (rainbows usually don’t feed much in total darkness). So give a negative at night (nearly zero score at night for these).
   Brown Trout: Browns are more nocturnal by nature (big browns feed at night in open water). Under ice in lakes, browns often bite at dawn and dusk strongly, and can also feed after dark. So for brown trout, we might allow some night bite possibility (+5 at night), and strong +10 at dusk/dawn. Daytime bright sun might actually be tough for browns since they spook easily in clear water. So on a clear day midday, browns might be negative (–5). If cloudy, they might roam more. We can incorporate some cloud sensitivity for brown trout specifically (if we wanted that detail: i.e. apply the cloud cover bonus more strongly for browns).
   Weather: Trout in general are less deterred by cold (they thrive in cold water). Pressure changes: they do feel them (they have swim bladders). Anecdotally, trout can bite through fronts somewhat, but there’s still usually a dip after a major storm (especially rainbows can get finicky after fronts). We will include pressure but maybe moderately. They also love stable weather (consistent conditions keeps them feeding steadily each day). A storm coming might trigger a feeding push (rainbows sometimes go crazy before a snowstorm too). So use similar logic but scaled a bit down.
   Channel Catfish: Deep holes, sporadic feeders. Channel cats in winter often gather in deep wintering holes and feed very infrequently (maybe once every few days). They are typically more active in late winter or when temperatures moderate. For scoring:
   Afternoon/Evening: Some winter catfish bites occur in afternoon or just after sunset. We can put a slight peak late in the day (say +5 in late afternoon into early evening) when water might have warmed a tad or they decide to move.
   Night: Unlike summer, winter night catfishing is generally slow (channel cats aren’t actively hunting at night in near-freezing water; they mostly sit). We can assume very low at night (score near 0).
   Morning: Also very low – they don’t really do dawn feeding sprees in winter.
   Essentially, the score for catfish under ice will rarely stray far from low values (they’re one of the tougher catches in mid-winter). But on a warm trend or after stable weather, there can be a short feeding window midday or late day. We reflect that with a small bump there.
   Weather: Channel cats, lacking scales and having an open swim bladder, might not be as barometer-sensitive as walleye. They care more about water temperature. A warm spell might actually get them moving (so weight temperature heavily for catfish: if a warm front pushes air temps above freezing for a day or two, perhaps channel cats become active enough to bite). A brutal cold snap, they nearly hibernate (score bottom out). So pressure indirectly via cold front matters (mostly because of temp drop). We’ll emphasize temperature factor for them.
   Flathead Catfish: Nearly dormant in winter. Flatheads basically hunker down in log jams or deep holes and barely eat all winter. It is extremely rare to catch one through the ice. Therefore, our forecast for flathead catfish in winter will almost always be poor. We can effectively set the flathead’s bite score very low (maybe 5 or 10 out of 100 at best) unless we have unusual data (e.g. maybe in a warmwater discharge or something – outside normal lake conditions). For consistency, we still run the algorithm, but perhaps cap the flathead scores: e.g. treat any positive factors as minimal. Time-of-day for flathead: no particular feeding time in winter because they seldom feed (maybe a slight possibility at dusk). We might not even bother with golden hour for them – safe to assume near 0 all day. (We can communicate to users that flathead fishing is effectively “off” during ice season.)
   Lake Sturgeon: Bottom-feeder, can be caught ice fishing typically early/late in day. Lake sturgeon through ice are caught by setlines or jigging in deep holes (like on the St. Croix or Rainy River). They are most active at certain times:
   Dawn/Morning: A known pattern is a morning bite for sturgeon in winter – likely just after sunrise through mid-morning can be good (give +10 in early morning)
   globalseafoods.com
   .
   Late Afternoon/Dusk: Another good period can be late afternoon toward sunset (+10). They often have feeding spurts when light changes or when daily water flow might change (not as relevant in lakes).
   Night: Sturgeon can be active at night too (some anglers get them in the dark), but much of the best action is daylight or twilight in winter. We might allow a small +5 at night, but not as high as the day peaks.
   Midday: Possibly slower – give baseline or slight negative midday if nothing else is happening.
   Weather: Sturgeon have a bit different physiology (cartilaginous skeleton, and some ability to gulp air). They may not feel barometric pressure as acutely as fish with swim bladders. However, big weather changes could still affect their food (invertebrates) or movement. We’ll include pressure trends but perhaps downweight it for sturgeon. Instead, stable conditions might be fine for them, and they’ll feed when they need to. Still, anecdotal evidence suggests they bite better during stable or slightly dropping pressure than after a big front. So we follow general trends but not extreme.
   Sauger: Very similar to walleye (often co-occurring). Sauger, being close cousins to walleye, have nearly the same patterns: low-light feeding, active at dawn/dusk, can also bite at night. If anything, sauger in some environments (like big rivers or stained water) might feed a bit more during daylight than walleye do, because low visibility allows it. But for simplicity, treat sauger the same as walleye in the model: strong dawn/dusk/night bite, weaker midday (especially in clear water lakes; in turbid water midday can be okay). So, we’ll mirror walleye’s multipliers for sauger. Weather sensitivity: same as walleye – very responsive to pressure changes and cloud cover.
   Cisco (Tullibee): Open-water plankton feeder (whitefish family). Ciscoes (also called tullibee) are often caught while targeting lake trout or pike and they feed on zooplankton and small minnows. Under ice, cisco tend to roam in the water column and can be caught during daylight hours primarily. They often bite well in late morning through afternoon when plankton are active and there’s enough light for them to see. They are less of a dawn/dusk feeder compared to predators – in fact, on sunny days they might actually feed more mid-day. So:
   Midday/Afternoon: Mark this as the peak for cisco. +10 late morning to afternoon.
   Dawn/Dusk: Cisco can still feed some at low light, but they don’t have particularly special low-light vision. Early and late hours might be slightly less productive than mid-day for them. Maybe just baseline or a slight +5 at dawn/dusk if they’re around.
   Night: Cisco typically do not feed in darkness (they’d have trouble seeing plankton). So score goes very low at night (0).
   Weather: Cisco might be less affected by barometric pressure; being a schooling open-water fish, they might continue feeding as long as plankton move. But large weather shifts (storms) could cause plankton to move deeper or fish to change depth. We can include minor pressure adjustments, but cisco might keep feeding even during some moderate high pressure (just perhaps a bit deeper). For our purposes, we’ll still give them a boost on cloudy days if plankton stay higher (clouds might reduce light so plankton stay shallower longer – which could actually reduce cisco feeding if plankton don’t come up? That’s complex). To simplify: assume cisco like consistent conditions, feed in day, and will feed a bit more if a front is coming (like other fish, they might join the general uptick in activity pre-storm). So small weight on pressure events for them.
   Burbot (Eelpout): Nocturnal, late-winter spawning fish. Burbot are unique: they spawn in mid-late winter under the ice, typically at night, and are very active at night during that period. Even outside spawn, burbot are known to feed heavily after dark. They often start moving shallow to feed at sundown, with a peak bite in the early night hours (say 6 PM to 10 PM)
   mackslure.com
   facebook.com
   . Some anglers also find a secondary bite just before sunrise.
   Night (especially evening): Major boost. We give burbot a +15 around the 2-4 hours after sunset – that’s often prime time
   mackslure.com
   . We can keep scores relatively high through midnight. Very late night (after midnight towards 3-4 AM) might taper off a bit, but burbot can still bite in the dark, so not zero.
   Dawn: Possibly a smaller uptick (some reports of a pre-dawn bite). Maybe +5 in the hour around sunrise.
   Daytime: Burbot spend day in deeper water, not very active. We penalize daytime (–10 or more) making midday scores low. They might bite a bit during spawn even in day, but typically night is far superior
   reddit.com
   .
   Weather: Burbot might be less sensitive to fronts compared to other fish. They have a swim bladder but are benthic and spawn regardless of weather. Still, before a storm at night might further amp up their feeding (so if a snowstorm coincides with nighttime, that could be a burbot bonanza!). We’ll include pressure events but main driver for burbot is time-of-day (night) and time-of-season (they get more active approaching their spawn late Jan/Feb – outside scope of hourly weather, but if we had date we could give a seasonal trend; for now assume mid-winter which is indeed their pre-spawn heavy feed period).
9. Combining All Factors into a Final Bite Score
   Now that we have the individual components – weather-based adjustments and species-specific time-of-day behavior – we outline how to compute the final score for each hour in the 5-day forecast:
   Initialize Baseline: Start each species’ score at 50 (representing average conditions/time). This is our neutral midpoint.
   Apply Time-of-Day Multiplier/Adjustment: For the given hour, determine where it falls relative to sunrise/sunset and apply the species’ time-based factor:
   E.g., if it’s 1 hour before sunset and we’re evaluating walleye, we know walleye have a big dusk boost. We might add, say, +15 right away for that hour
   fishusa.com
   fishusa.com
   . Or equivalently multiply baseline by a factor (like 1.3) to represent that boost.
   If it’s midnight and the species is bluegill, we’d subtract a large amount (essentially setting near 0) because bluegill don’t feed at night.
   This step establishes a preliminary score based purely on daily feeding rhythm ignoring weather. It ensures the score respects biological feeding times (e.g., a noon score for walleye will start lower than a dusk score, all else equal).
   Calculate Weather Factor Adjustments: For the same hour, evaluate each weather factor:
   Determine pressure trend at that hour. For example, compare pressure at surrounding hours or use forecasted pressure change. Classify it as falling, rising, or stable, and apply the corresponding points (+/-) as per Section 1. Also consider absolute pressure: if the value is beyond our high/low thresholds, include those penalties/bonuses.
   Check pressure event context: We should look at the broader forecast to see if this hour is ahead of a front or just after one. If the hour lies, say, 3 hours before a predicted big pressure low (storm), then include the “pre-storm feeding frenzy” bonus on top
   fishusa.com
   . If it’s 6 hours into a rising-pressure post-front period, include the extra post-storm penalty.
   Determine temperature condition: Identify if the hour is during an extreme cold period or a warming trend. If the daily high is extremely low and this hour is within that cold snap, subtract the cold penalty. If we see a warming from previous days and this hour’s temp is higher than yesterday’s by a threshold, add a warming bonus.
   Cloud cover: Note the cloud percentage at that hour. If >= ~80%, treat as overcast – add bonuses for the species that benefit (predators) or mitigate midday penalty. If <=20% (clear), apply any sunlight penalties for light-shy species at that hour.
   Precipitation: Check POP and precipitation volume at that hour:
   If POP is high in future hours and this hour is leading up to it, apply the pre-storm boost.
   If precipitation (snow) is currently happening this hour, decide if it’s light (no penalty) or heavy (maybe slight penalty during the peak).
   If this hour is just after precipitation ended (storm just passed), enforce the post-storm negative.
   Wind: Note wind gusts if very high at this hour. If yes, maybe subtract a couple points (especially if it’s also snowing heavily — likely already accounted, but wind could add a bit more noise factor).
   Essentially, for each factor we add or subtract points as detailed earlier. Many factors will be zero most of the time (e.g., if no front is happening, pressure trend = stable => 0 points; if it’s a normal day with some clouds => maybe small adjustments only).
   Sum up Adjustments: Add the time-of-day adjusted baseline and all weather adjustments. For example:
   Start 50.
   Time-of-day gave +15 (dusk for walleye) → 65.
   Pressure is falling fast → +12 → 77.
   It’s overcast → +5 for walleye → 82.
   Temp is moderate/stable → 0.
   Snow starting in 2 hours (pre-front) → +5 → 87.
   Wind moderate → 0.
   Sum = 87 out of 100 for that hour (which would be an excellent bite score for walleye at that time).
   This sum is the raw score before final limits.
   Clamp to 0–100 Range: Ensure the combined score does not go below 0 or above 100. If our adjustments push it outside bounds, cap it. For instance, if multiple poor factors coincide (e.g., post-front + midday + extreme cold for walleye), the sum might be, say, 50 – 15 (post-front) – 10 (midday sun) – 10 (extreme cold) = 15 → that’s fine (15 out of 100, very poor). If it ever calculated to a negative, we’d just floor it at 0. Conversely, if everything is perfect (dusk + falling pressure + cloudy + warm spell), maybe we get 50 + 15 + 15 + 5 + 5 = 90 – that’s within range. Conceivably, a rare scenario could sum slightly above 100; we’d cap at 100 (no more than “excellent”).
   Smoothing Over Hours (if needed): Because we will generate 24 hourly points per day (via interpolation of 3-hour forecast data), it’s wise to apply a slight smoothing so adjacent hours don’t jump erratically due to minor forecast blips. The main drivers (sunrise/sunset) already create a smooth curve of feeding activity, and weather factors usually change gradually. However, forecasts can sometimes zigzag (e.g., pressure might oscillate a tiny bit). To avoid the score graph looking jagged, we can:
   Use linear interpolation for weather data between 3h forecast points (we are doing that for weather variables as per the interpolation plan).
   Possibly take a moving average over 2–3 hour window on the final score to smooth any one-hour spikes. But be careful not to blur real sharp events (like the immediate post-front crash – that should remain evident).
   The goal is that the “Bite Forecast” curve changes gently hour to hour, reflecting real transitions, not noise.
   Species Differentiation: Remember we run this calculation for each species separately. Each species has its own time-of-day profile and maybe slightly different weights for the weather factors. For example, at 1 PM on a given day:
   Walleye might have base time score 30 (low, because it’s bright midday), but pike might have 50 (they’re okay midday), bluegill might have 55 (they like midday). Then we add weather: if a storm is coming that evening, walleye might go to 50 (from 30 +20 weather), pike to 65 (50 +15), bluegill to 60 (55 +5 maybe, since pressure affects them less).
   Thus, the output “matrix” would show different scores by hour by species.
   Threshold Labels (Good/Fair/Poor): We can define ranges for the user interface to label the bite quality:
   80–100: Excellent – fish are very active (many factors aligned in your favor).
   60–79: Good – above average bite, should see decent action.
   40–59: Fair/Moderate – typical activity, fish might bite but expect slower periods.
   20–39: Poor – below average, tough bite (fish mostly negative).
   0–19: Very Poor – fish are likely inactive (e.g., after a severe front or middle of the night for day-feeders).
   These thresholds aren’t directly part of calculation but help interpret the 0–100 score for anglers.
   Throughout the 5-day forecast, the system should look ahead and adjust scores not just in isolation but knowing what’s coming. For example, if Day 3 has a big blizzard, Day 2’s evening gets a boost, Day 3 midday gets weird (some boost early, then maybe a drop during blizzard peak), and Day 4 morning gets a strong penalty (post-blizzard high pressure). The algorithm, as described, inherently does this by using forecast trends (pressure, POP, etc.) in each hour’s calculation – thereby taking into account the full 5-day picture of upcoming events. Finally, it’s important that as the weather forecast updates (which it will frequently), the scoring adjusts but does not flip-flop wildly. By using defined thresholds and not over-sensitizing to tiny changes (e.g., requiring a significant pressure drop to go into “falling” category), we avoid too much fluctuation. Small forecast corrections (say pressure tomorrow 1010 vs 1008 hPa) won’t entirely change a score from good to poor – it might tweak it by a couple points. Major forecast changes (front speed changes by 6 hours) will shift when the score spike/drop occurs, which is expected. The weighting ensures the system is responsive to meaningful weather events but stable under minor forecast noise.

   Species-specific tuning: Each species’ profile (as listed above) dictates how strongly each factor affects them (e.g., bass care more about warmth, walleye care more about clouds/pressure, etc.) and when they feed (time-of-day shape).
   Combination and Clamping: Sum all adjustments for a given hour and species to get the raw score, then clamp to \[0, 100]. Use threshold ranges to categorize the result (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor) for user-friendly display.
   Hourly resolution via interpolation: We fill in weather data for every hour (interpolating between 3-hour forecast points for smooth transitions), so the score can be calculated for each of the 24 hours in a day. This yields a fine-grained bite forecast graph, highlighting even short bite windows (e.g. a two-hour dawn feeding spike).
   Example outcome: The system might output something like: “Walleye bite 7am: 72 (Good); 1pm: 30 (Poor); 5pm: 85 (Excellent)

   .” This would correspond to a dawn bite and dusk bite being strong, midday slow – which matches known patterns, modulated by any weather that day.
