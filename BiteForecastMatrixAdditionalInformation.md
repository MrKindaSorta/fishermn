Ice Fishing Bite Score System (Winter Season) – Weather Factors \& Scoring Method

Overview

For each hour and for each fish species, we will calculate a “bite score” from 0 to 100. We start at a neutral baseline of 50 (average bite conditions – not great, not terrible) and then adjust that score based on a variety of weather-related factors and species-specific behavior. The goal is to incorporate as many weather “events” and conditions as possible (pressure changes, cloud cover, temperature swings, etc.) that are known to affect fish activity, especially in Minnesota’s ice-fishing season. The scoring system is described in plain language below, with clear thresholds and weights for good, fair, or poor conditions, and how to combine everything into a final bite score.

Key Weather Factors and Weighting Criteria

Each relevant weather factor from the forecast will adjust the bite score up or down. Below we list each factor, why it matters, and how to score it (what is considered good, fair, or poor for fish biting). All adjustments are given in relative points to add or subtract from the baseline (we will combine them later). We also note approximate weighting (in points) for each factor – these can be tuned, but give a sense of impact (higher weight means a bigger effect on the score).

1\. Barometric Pressure \& Trend – Highest weight factor (~±20 points)

Why it matters: Fish are very sensitive to barometric pressure changes because of their swim bladders

. Under ice, pressure changes still penetrate the water column and affect fish comfort

midwestoutdoors.com

midwestoutdoors.com

. Pressure is often the number one predictor of bite activity for ice fishing.

Falling Pressure (approaching low-pressure system) – This is typically prime time. A dropping barometer (especially a gradual fall) often triggers fish to feed actively in the hours leading up to a storm

fishusa.com

. As a storm front approaches and pressure begins to fall, fish feel less “weight” on them, become comfortable and often go on the bite

midwestoutdoors.com

midwestoutdoors.com

. We treat a steadily falling pressure as very good: for example, if pressure has dropped significantly or is forecast to drop soon (within the next few hours), we add points (e.g. +10 to +20). The maximum boost would be just before a major low hits – fish tend to feed hard in the window 2–12 hours before a storm arrives

fishusa.com

.

Thresholds: A drop of ~0.1 inch (or several millibars) over a few hours is notable. For a moderate pressure fall, add around +10. A rapid or large pressure fall (indicative of a strong storm coming) could merit up to +20 (near the moment of biggest change). This positive bump should be applied slightly before and during the pressure drop – essentially forecasting the bite peak right before the storm or low-pressure event hits

fishusa.com

.

Low Pressure (deep low, during a storm) – Once the pressure is very low (e.g. during the heart of a storm system), the bite may actually slow down if that low is extreme or long-lasting

mossyoak.com

. Fish often feed before the storm and then become cautious or sluggish when pressure is at the extreme low point or the weather is actively bad (heavy snow, etc.)

facebook.com

mossyoak.com

. So, if pressure drops below a certain threshold (e.g. < ~29.6 inHg or ~1002 hPa), we consider that poor/low pressure extreme – fish might have already fed or might be hunkering down

tempest.earth

. We would subtract a few points (e.g. –5 or more) once the pressure gets very low. In practice, this means the score might peak just before the lowest pressure, then dip slightly during an intense storm (reflecting that frenzy has passed).

Rising Pressure (post-front high) – Rapidly rising pressure (usually as a cold front arrives with clear skies) is typically bad for fishing. After a storm passes and high pressure builds in (“bluebird” clear sky), fish often become lethargic and need time to adjust

midwestoutdoors.com

midwestoutdoors.com

. A fast rise in pressure is a negative event: we subtract points (e.g. –10 to –15) during the hours just after a big pressure jump. This corresponds to the classic tough bite right after a front clears out. Fish may move deeper and lose appetite when the barometer jumps up

midwestoutdoors.com

mossyoak.com

.

Thresholds: If pressure increases sharply (say +0.1″ in a few hours) or goes from low to high quickly, apply a significant penalty (–15). Even a moderate uptick after stable low can warrant –5 to –10. The first 12–24 hours of high pressure are usually the worst – fish often won’t bite for up to a day or more until they acclimate to the new high pressure

midwestoutdoors.com

. We should gradually reduce the penalty after a day of stable high (see “Stability” below).

High Pressure (extended) – Very high barometric readings (>30.50″) are generally associated with cold, dense air and can suppress feeding interest

kestrelinstruments.com

tempest.earth

. Under the ice, extremely high pressure “presses” on the water, making fish uncomfortable (it can literally compress their swim bladders)

midwestoutdoors.com

. So if pressure is above ~30.50″ (1033 hPa), it’s considered poor – fish likely in a negative mood

kestrelinstruments.com

. We might give an ongoing penalty (e.g. –5 points) during periods of extremely high pressure. However, if that high pressure persists for several days, fish gradually resume normal behavior

in-depthoutdoors.com

in-depthoutdoors.com

&nbsp;– so we don’t keep the score low forever. Essentially: extreme high = initial drop in score, then slowly recovering back toward baseline after ~24+ hours of no change as fish acclimate.

Stable or Normal Pressure – When pressure is steady and in a middle range, fish are typically comfortable and feeding periodically. In fact, a stable barometer in the “normal” range (~29.8–30.2″) is often associated with the most reliable fishing

tempest.earth

. If pressure hasn’t changed much in the last several hours and lies in the mid-range, we consider that fair to good. No big adjustments are needed – perhaps a small +5 if it’s smack in the ideal zone. Consistently steady, moderate pressure (neither very high nor very low) keeps fish in a routine of regular feeding

tempest.earth

. Many veteran anglers say steady pressure (especially after fish have adjusted for a day) yields the best prolonged bite

in-depthoutdoors.com

. So: Stable-normal = baseline 0 adjustment or a slight plus.

Pressure Trend Summary: Falling = plus, Rising = minus, Steady = neutral or slight plus, Extremes = minus. We will weight pressure heavily because it can swing the bite drastically. For example, at the peak of a great pre-storm bite, pressure factors might contribute +15 or more, whereas right after a brutal cold-front, pressure could contribute –15 or even –20 if it’s an extreme high. This reflects real experience: fish “feed hard before weather hits” and often shut down in the immediate aftermath

2\. Cloud Cover \& Light Levels – Moderate weight (~±5 to ±10 points, species-dependent)

Why it matters: Clouds determine how much light penetrates the ice. Light level influences fish feeding – many species feed more in low-light conditions under ice

piscifun.com

fishusa.com

, while some sight-feeders need light to hunt. In winter, overcast skies often improve fishing because they extend those low-light periods during the day

fishusa.com

. However, the effect of clouds can depend on existing ice/snow cover and species: if there’s little snow on clear ice, even a bit of cloud can significantly darken the underwater world, which might slow down fish that rely on vision (they can’t see the bait)

in-depthoutdoors.com

. We account for cloud cover as follows:

Overcast (high cloud cover, ~70–100%) – Generally a positive for ice fishing. Cloudy days mean less light penetration, which often makes fish feel safer and more likely to venture out to feed during daytime

flopindustries.com

fishusa.com

. Overcast skies are famously good for species like walleye that avoid bright light – on a dark, cloudy day, walleye and others may feed even at noon as if it were dawn

piscifun.com

. Therefore, if cloud cover is heavy, we typically add to the score (e.g. +5 points for >~75% clouds). This boost might be larger for light-sensitive species (see species section below) – for example, walleye might get up to +10 on a very cloudy day, whereas a sun-loving sight feeder might get a smaller boost. Also, if a lake has little snow cover (clear ice conditions), clouds become even more important: a sudden cloudy day could dramatically drop light levels under water, possibly causing a short-term bite slowdown until fish adjust or anglers change lures

in-depthoutdoors.com

. (In those cases we might not boost the score too much for clouds, especially for panfish that need to see tiny baits – but as a general rule, clouds are a plus in winter).

Partly Cloudy (~30–70% cloud) – This is a neutral to slight positive scenario. Partial clouds can be beneficial by periodically reducing glare under the ice, without plunging the lake into darkness. Fish often behave normally, feeding at dawn/dusk and maybe a bit during cloud cover periods. We might treat this as baseline (0) to +2 points. If the day was clear and a patch of clouds rolls in, you might see a minor uptick in bite during the cloudy stretch, but overall it’s average conditions.

Clear skies (0–30% cloud) – In winter, clear skies usually come with high pressure (often post-cold-front). Clear, bright days can make fish more cautious and less active, especially around mid-day

midwestoutdoors.com

midwestoutdoors.com

. Bright sun penetrating the ice (especially if the ice is clear or there’s little snow) can actually deter low-light predators from feeding until dusk. So we consider bluebird clear days a potential negative for the bite. We might subtract a few points (e.g. –5 if it’s a very bright day at a normally good feeding time). This negative is strongest for species like walleye that dislike bright light – they may hug cover or go inactive during sunny afternoons. On the other hand, clear skies after a long dark period might spur some panfish to feed a bit if they suddenly get light to see their food – but generally, under ice, bright high-pressure days are known for being tough fishing

midwestoutdoors.com

mossyoak.com

. We will lean toward penalizing clear sky conditions slightly, especially if coinciding with high pressure.

Cloud cover \& time of day interaction: We will also factor in when it’s cloudy. Clouds matter most during daylight hours. For example, a heavy overcast at noon can boost midday bite, but clouds at midnight don’t matter (it’s dark regardless). So the cloud cover adjustment mainly applies during daytime hours. At night, we effectively ignore cloud cover for scoring (except moonlight, which we are not focusing on here). During dawn/dusk, clouds can extend the “dusk” feel longer – which might modestly help the bite stay hot a bit longer into the morning or start earlier in the evening. So we might keep the score elevated slightly longer on a cloudy sunrise or sunset compared to a rapidly brightening clear morning. These nuances will be handled by the hour-by-hour logic. Overall, expect a ~+5 boost on cloudy days, and ~–5 on very clear days for most species (with some variation by species as noted later).

3\. Temperature \& Cold Fronts – Moderate weight (~±5 to ±10 points)

Why it matters: Air temperature itself doesn’t directly change water temp under thick ice (the water below stays ~39°F/4°C near the bottom), but air temp is a good indicator of cold fronts or warm fronts, which affect fish behavior. Also, extremely cold weather can reduce anglers’ activity (not directly fish, but we assume we’re focusing on fish response). We use temperature mainly as a proxy for fronts and overall comfort: a sudden drop in air temperature usually means a cold front with high pressure (bad for bite), while a sudden warm-up often means a low-pressure system or at least milder conditions (often better for fish activity).

Sudden Cold Front (big temp drop) – If the forecast shows a sharp temperature fall (for example, a drop of >15°F within 12–24 hours), that’s typically associated with an incoming arctic high-pressure front – which spells poor fishing. Fish often shut down during and right after a severe cold front

in-depthoutdoors.com

. We will subtract points for a significant temp plunge, especially during the onset of that cold. For instance, if tomorrow’s high is much lower than today’s and the cold hits overnight, the morning bite might be much worse – we could apply –5 or –10 in those post-front frigid hours. Likewise, if it’s –20°F with high pressure, fish metabolism is slow and they’re unlikely to chase bait. So extremely low air temps (well below average) get a negative weight, reinforcing what pressure already indicated.

Warming Trend (rising temps) – A milder weather spell in mid-winter can improve fish activity. If the air temperature is climbing day-to-day (say from near 0°F up to 25°F over a day or two), it often coincides with a low-pressure or at least a gentler system. Fish can become a bit more active during such warm-ups

kestrelinstruments.com

. We will add a few points for a warming trend or above-average winter temps. For example, if a bitter cold spell breaks and afternoon highs reach, say, the freezing point (32°F) after a long subzero stretch, we might give +5 to reflect fish coming out of a lethargic period. Similarly, stable double-digit temperatures (10–30°F, rather normal winter temps) are better than single-digits or below zero

kestrelinstruments.com

, so that stability/warmth can bump the score up slightly. Essentially, a thaw or mild spell = a small boost.

Absolute extremes: If air temp is extremely cold (e.g. < –10°F without windchill), even if pressure is stable, fish might reduce activity – they’ve been under high pressure and cold air, likely slow metabolism. Conversely, if it’s unusually warm (say mid-30s or 40°F in mid-winter, perhaps during a winter rain), that might invigorate some fish (and certainly anglers!). But extremely warm might also come with a storm and low pressure – which we already count positively. So we treat temperature mostly as supporting evidence: e.g., flag a major cold front (big drop = apply negative), or flag a warm front (big rise = positive). For steady moderate cold (e.g. every day around 10°F low, 25°F high), we consider that normal – no adjustment needed unless it’s changing.

Ice safety note (not part of score): If it gets too warm it could weaken ice, but that’s outside our scoring – we’re focusing on fish biting, not angling conditions.

In summary, use temperature changes as an event indicator: rapid cooling = reduce score, rapid warming = increase score, on the order of a few points (5-ish). If temp is steady and typical for the season, treat as neutral (no change). This factor helps capture those “boom or bust” bites when a front passes (often temp drop) and when a Chinook or warm front arrives.

4\. Wind Speed \& Gusts – Minor to moderate weight (~±5 points, context-dependent)

Why it matters: Wind itself doesn’t affect underwater fish much when the lake is frozen (no waves or mixing under solid ice). However, wind is a hallmark of changing weather. Strong winds often accompany storms or frontal boundaries and can signal when a front is arriving or departing. Additionally, wind direction can hint at front type (e.g. a sudden switch to northwest with high gusts often means a cold front has just passed). We mainly use wind as a secondary indicator for other events (pressure changes, storm arrival) and a sanity check on conditions. Also, in open-water fishing wind can stir up food and reduce light, but under ice this is less direct – though wind might drift snow which can change light penetration on the ice (a windy snowstorm could quickly cover clear ice with snow).

High Wind / Gusty Conditions (e.g. >15–20 mph or strong gusts) – If we see very windy conditions in the forecast, that typically means a significant weather system is in progress. Before the wind peaks, often there’s a feeding uptick (the “calm before the storm”). During extremely windy blizzard conditions, fish might lay low (just as pressure bottoms out)

facebook.com

. So we will coordinate wind with pressure/precip: for example, just as wind is about to ramp up, that likely coincides with falling pressure – we might already have a high score from pressure factor. We could give a small additional boost (+5) if a high wind event is imminent (indicating the front is hitting now and fish are already active). Conversely, if it’s very windy under clear skies (rare in winter – clear skies usually have lighter wind, but perhaps a strong arctic blast can be windy and high pressure), high wind chill and stirring might just further stress fish (and anglers). In such cases we might apply a slight negative. But generally, windy and cloudy with falling pressure = good (we already score that via pressure/cloud), and windy and clear with rising pressure = bad. Wind gust data can help refine timing: if a forecast shows gusts peaking at 5 PM, we might assume the front’s main effect occurs around that time (fish activity spike just before 5, then a lull after).

Calm or Light Wind (e.g. <5 mph) – Calm conditions often correspond to stable high pressure. A string of calm, sunny days can mean fish have adjusted and might feed routinely (or in some cases, if it’s calm immediately after a front, it’s that dreaded silent “bluebird” period when fish are still off). We treat calm conditions as neutral by themselves, but interpret them in context: if it’s calm and high-pressure day 1, that’s likely a tough bite (high pressure factor already gave –points). If it’s calm and high-pressure day 3, fish might be back to normal (no extra penalty; pressure penalty might be gone too by then). If it’s calm and low-pressure (rare combo), perhaps the storm center is overhead – could be a lull. In short, wind by itself won’t drastically change the score, but we’ll use it to fine-tune the timing and confidence of other factor adjustments.

Wind Direction (optional) – In Minnesota, a common saying: “Winds from the west, fish bite best; winds from the east, fish bite least.” This is a loose rule reflecting that east winds often come with a big approaching low or post-front high. We can incorporate direction qualitatively: e.g., strong East or Northeast winds often precede a big storm (pressure falling) – actually fish might bite before that storm (so east wind can actually mean a bite window is about to happen). Northwest winds are usually cold front aftermath (rising pressure, colder air) – that often means poor bite. So if we wanted, we could say: if wind direction is NW and it’s the first day of it, likely post-front – reinforce the negative from pressure. If wind is S or SE and increasing, likely pre-front – reinforce the positive from pressure drop. This is a subtle layer; we don’t need explicit point values for direction, but it helps interpret whether a wind is “good” or “bad” sign. We can keep this in mind when combining factors.

To summarize wind: use strong winds/gusts as an indicator of a significant weather event. A spike in wind combined with falling pressure and clouds = peak bite time (add a bit). Strong wind combined with clearing sky and rising pressure = post-front shutoff (subtract a bit). Light winds during stable weather = no change. Wind alone might be worth ±5 points at most, but usually it’s already accounted for by the pressure/precip factors.

5\. Precipitation (Snow) \& Humidity – Moderate weight (~±5 points)

Why it matters: Precipitation probability and intensity tell us if there’s an active weather event like snowfall. During ice-fishing season in Minnesota, this will mostly be snow (or maybe sleet/freezing rain). Precipitation ties closely to pressure and clouds – a high chance of snow means low pressure system overhead or approaching. Fish often feed more just before and during the onset of a snow event, then slow during the tail end of a long storm

fishusa.com

. We will use precipitation data to reinforce the timing of bite surges, and the amount of snow to adjust light conditions for the following hours/days.

Precipitation Probability (PoP) – This gives the likelihood of precip in each forecast hour. A high PoP (e.g. >50–60%) indicates it is snowing or about to snow. When we see PoP rising sharply, that’s a cue that a storm is imminent. We will treat a high PoP as a positive trigger leading up to that hour. For example, if from 12pm to 3pm the snow probability jumps from 20% to 80%, fish are likely to feel the pressure drop and start biting before the snow hits hard. So we might boost the score in the hours just before and as the PoP goes high (this overlaps with the falling pressure logic). Once the probability is 80–100% (meaning it is snowing steadily), we consider we are in the storm. The bite might still be decent at the beginning of snowfall (often fish don’t mind a gentle snow and may even continue feeding in a light snow), but if it’s a prolonged heavy snow, eventually the bite can taper off (fish might have fed already and now hunker down). To reflect that, we could slightly reduce the score during long continuous precipitation. In practice: rising PoP = add +5 (short-term), sustained 100% PoP for many hours = gradually apply a –5 as time goes on (especially if other factors like pressure already bottomed out).

Snow Volume/Rate – The forecast may provide snowfall volume (e.g. mm per hour). This tells us how intense the snow is. A light snow (trace to <1 mm/hr) likely won’t bother fish much at all – it just signals the low pressure. A heavy snowfall (several mm/hr, or “snowstorm/blizzard” conditions) could coincide with very low pressure and potentially fish going idle. Also, a heavy snowfall will quickly cover the ice with a fresh blanket of snow, dramatically reducing light penetration under the ice afterward

midwestoutdoors.com

. This can have a short-term effect: as the snow is falling heavily, it gets darker underwater; some fish (like walleye) might actually love that and continue to feed (they often feed well in the dark). Others that need light (panfish) might pause because they can’t see. If the heavy snow continues for hours, oxygen and light under the ice drop, which can slow fish activity until things stabilize. To score this: if precipitation volume is high, we might limit how long we keep the score boosted. We might peak the score at the beginning of the snowfall, and then if heavy snow persists 3-6 hours, apply a small penalty (–5) to subsequent hours to indicate the bite slowing during the storm’s peak. After the storm, with fresh deep snow on the ice, daytime conditions under the ice will be darker going forward – which in coming days might help low-light feeders (they effectively get perpetual cloud cover), but might hurt fish that needed light. This is a more long-term effect; it’s hard to account for in a 5-day hourly forecast except to say: if a lot of new snow just fell, perhaps treat the next day as if it’s extra cloudy (we could internally adjust the cloud factor or baseline for those hours).

Rain/Ice (if any) – In rare warm winter situations, if rain is forecast on ice (say late season or weird weather), the same principles apply: rain with falling pressure can trigger feeding. Rain also oxygenates the top layer of water (if there are any open holes or cracks), but under full ice cover this is minimal. Heavy rain might create noise on the ice and could spook fish less than thunder would in summer (thunder unlikely in winter). We won’t likely see rain in mid-winter in MN, but if we do, consider it akin to snow in terms of pressure effect. (Also note: rain on ice can melt snow and actually increase light penetration afterward by clearing ice surface, opposite of snow – that could temporarily improve sight-feeding conditions. This level of nuance may be beyond scope, but worth noting if needed.)

Humidity – Humidity is a supporting indicator. High humidity (near 100%) in winter often means an impending snowfall or fog. Rising humidity can precede precipitation. If we have humidity data, we can use it to reinforce precip signals: e.g., very high humidity before any snow starts might hint that conditions are primed for a storm – fish could already sense the change. We might give a tiny pre-emptive boost if humidity is, say, >90% and pressure is just starting to fall, to account for fish feeling the moisture in the air. Conversely, very low humidity (dry air) usually comes with high pressure cold fronts. If humidity is extremely low (say <40% in winter, which is dry, cold air), that supports the notion of a post-front high – fish likely still tough to catch. We might give a minor penalty in that case. However, these would be small adjustments (1–3 points) just to make the model a bit more sensitive to upcoming changes.

In summary, precipitation is closely tied to the pressure factor. We’ll use PoP and precip rate to time the “bite score spike” (maxing just before or as precipitation begins), and to slightly dial down the score during prolonged heavy precipitation. Think of it this way: Approaching storm (high PoP, low pressure) = great bite window; Long blizzard = fish eventually slow. Overall weight is moderate – maybe ±5 points distinct from the pressure’s effect. (Often pressure, clouds, and precip will all point in the same direction, so their effects stack a bit.)

6\. Other Factors (Visibility, Oxygen, etc.) – Minor or contextual

The OpenWeather data also offers some other fields like visibility, and we have season/context factors (like ice thickness, oxygen levels) that are not directly in the API but worth mentioning, even if we don’t directly score them with a number:

Visibility: This is atmospheric visibility (fog, etc.). In winter, fog or low visibility might occur during temperature inversions or near a front with humid air. Fog could indicate mild air (possibly a warm front) – which might be a good sign for fish (warming trend). Alternatively, freezing fog could happen in high pressure cold mornings. We likely won’t use visibility explicitly, as it doesn’t affect underwater light much (unless it’s a sign of clouds/humidity). It’s more of an FYI – if visibility is reported very low and humidity high, it’s likely a moisture-rich system (possibly good fishing). If visibility is unlimited and sky clear, that aligns with high pressure (we already handle that). So we can safely omit a direct “visibility score” and trust our cloud/humidity/pressure to cover those effects.

Ice/Snow Depth on Ice: Not in the API, but as context: As winter progresses, thick ice and heavy snow cover can reduce oxygen and light in the water

midwestoutdoors.com

. By late winter, some lakes develop low oxygen in deep areas, causing fish to either become very lethargic or move shallow. While we can’t get this data from weather, we should be aware that in the bite forecast, late-season (late Feb) fish might be less active overall no matter the weather. We won’t formalize this in the scoring system here, but it might be something to adjust in the future or in general messaging (e.g., a note like “mid-winter doldrums”). For now, assume oxygen is okay and focus on weather factors.

Moon Phase \& Light at Night: The user didn’t ask for moon phase, but it does influence night bites. If needed, one could incorporate it (e.g., full moon nights can see walleye feeding more because there’s some light, whereas new moon nights might see less activity). Since this system is already complex, we will omit moon phase unless asked – but do note that predators may feed around moonrise/set even under ice

fishusa.com

. In absence of moon data, our time-of-day multipliers (next section) will handle typical night vs day activity on average.

With all the above factors defined, we have a collection of score adjustments for each hour’s weather conditions. Next, we need to account for time-of-day and species-specific behavior, then we’ll explain how to combine everything into the final score.

Time-of-Day Multipliers and Species Behavior

Fish have daily activity rhythms, and different species have different feeding habits – especially in winter. We will incorporate time-of-day multipliers to reflect that a given hour might be prime feeding time or a lull for a particular species. The approach is: for each species, define a baseline daily pattern (independent of weather) that indicates how active that fish tends to be at a given time. Then we’ll use that as a multiplier (or additive factor) on the weather-adjusted score. This ensures the score has hour-by-hour specificity, as requested, down to each hour’s bite potential. General rule (winter): Most fish species have peak activity during low-light periods (around dawn and dusk), even under ice

fishusa.com

fishusa.com

. Many also show secondary patterns like some feeding at night or midday depending on the species. We will start by boosting scores during the “golden hours” of sunrise and sunset, and reducing scores during off-peak times (e.g. midnight for sunfish, or midday for walleye). The multipliers will be species-specific. Below are guidelines, broken down by groups of the top 20 Minnesota species mentioned:

Walleye \& Sauger: Low-light predators. Walleye are famous for dawn/dusk bites and even nighttime feeding (they have excellent night vision)

piscifun.com

fishusa.com

. For these, we will set high multipliers around sunrise and sunset (e.g. 1.5× normal at the peak hour, tapering an hour or two on each side) to significantly raise their score during those times. Nighttime (after dark) remains productive for walleye (and sauger to a lesser extent) – not as high as dusk but still above daytime. We will keep a mild boost at night (say 1.2× baseline at night). Midday (especially bright midday) is usually slow for walleye; we’ll use a multiplier <1 (e.g. 0.7–0.8× around noon) to dampen their score then. In plain terms, walleye bite score might be “excellent” in early morning and evening, fair at night, and poor mid-day unless weather factors compensate. (Overcast weather can mitigate the midday lull, which will show up because our weather factor already gave a boost for clouds – so a cloudy noon for walleye might end up nearer to baseline instead of low). Sauger are similar to walleye in habit, maybe slightly more willing to feed in daylight (especially in stained water), but we can treat them roughly the same as walleye for simplicity.

Northern Pike \& Muskellunge: Visual hunters. Pike are known to feed during daylight more than walleye, and can be active all day, but still often show peak activity in early morning and late afternoon/dusk

fishusa.com

. We’ll give pike a dawn/dusk boost (maybe not as high as walleye, e.g. 1.3×) but also allow a fairly good base during daytime (maybe 1.0× baseline at midday, not as low as walleye’s 0.7×). Pike will strike throughout the day, especially if conditions like cloud cover make them comfortable to roam shallow all day

fishusa.com

. So their hourly multiplier curve is flatter. Muskellunge (muskie) are rarely caught in mid-winter (their metabolism is very slow in cold water, and in MN the muskie season is closed during mid/late winter), but if we include them, they’d have similar behavior to pike. Likely, they might only feed during narrow windows (the few times they do), often around dusk or dawn, so we could give them a strong twilight bias. But practically, mid-winter muskie fishing is minimal – we might simply note that their forecast exists but typically “poor” most of the time due to cold dormancy.

Largemouth \& Smallmouth Bass: Cold-season lethargy. Bass, especially largemouth, are cold-blooded and become very sluggish under ice. They feed infrequently in winter – maybe a small window in the warmest part of the day when sunlight slightly warms shallow water or when a warm front perks them up. We will give bass a much smaller range of variation because they’re mostly “off”. Possibly set a low baseline activity (say multiplier 0.5×) for most of the day and only bump it up to ~1.0× or 1.2× at a possible midday window (e.g. early afternoon) if conditions are favorable. In Minnesota ice-fishing, bass are not a primary target in midwinter, but if someone is curious, the system should reflect that it’s generally a low score across the board, maybe slightly higher on a sunny mid-afternoon (they might move a bit then to feed on a few minnows). Smallmouth bass handle cold slightly better than largemouth and often occupy slightly warmer deep pockets or spring areas. They might bite a bit more consistently than largemouth (e.g. some action early afternoon on mild days). But as a rule, we will keep bass species scores relatively low in winter unless an unusual warm trend or some special condition occurs.

Panfish – Perch, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Crappie: Frequent feeders but pattern varies. These smaller fish feed more regularly (they need to eat more often than big predators, even if slow). We will tailor each a bit:

Yellow Perch: Perch often have a morning bite flurry (they roam to feed after sunrise) and sometimes a lesser afternoon bite. They are sight feeders (no great night vision), so nighttime perch bite is typically poor. We will boost perch in the morning hours (say 7–10am) and again slightly in late afternoon (3–5pm), with midday being decent as well if light is good. On cloudy days, perch might continue feeding through noon (clouds don’t hinder them too much if it’s still light enough). We’ll probably not penalize midday for perch; possibly their multiplier is ~1.0 across most of daytime, with a peak of 1.2 in morning and another smaller peak near sunset, then dropping to ~0.5 at night.

Bluegill \& Pumpkinseed (sunfish): These also feed mostly in daylight. They often bite best in late morning and afternoon on sunny days in winter (they might need some light to see food and slightly warmer shallows). They don’t feed much at night (virtually zero bite in darkness). We’ll give sunfish a midday/afternoon high – e.g. peak multiplier around 1.2× in early-mid afternoon – and a drop off at sunset (maybe a small morning bump too but many bluegill anglers find mid-day can be fine). Essentially inverse of walleye – they like the sun (to a point). If it’s very bright and high pressure, they might hug weeds, but they’ll still nibble. We won’t penalize them for light, so a clear day that hurts walleye might actually be slightly good for bluegill. We can handle that by the species weight: e.g. when we gave a –5 for clear skies, we can reduce that penalty or zero it out for bluegill. But as a multiplier: Night = 0 for bluegill (no bite after dark), daytime = around 1.0, with slight increase mid-day.

Crappie (Black/White): Crappies are a bit different – they have larger eyes and commonly feed in low light and at night. Many ice anglers experience a “crappie night bite,” especially about an hour after sunset and onward into dark

targetwalleye.com

fishusa.com

. We will give crappie a strong evening/night multiplier. For example, late afternoon through a couple hours after dusk might be 1.5× (peak at maybe 1–2 hours after sunset when they often really turn on). They often suspend and feed on zooplankton or minnows that rise in the water column at night. Crappie can also feed at dawn, and if it’s an overcast day, they might bite on and off all day too

fishusa.com

&nbsp;– but typically mid-day is slower for crappie in clear conditions. So our crappie pattern: dusk and night = best (score boost), late morning/afternoon = moderate, mid-day = somewhat low (unless cloudy). We’ll incorporate overcast in weather (which for crappie, we will say overcast can make them feed sporadically even at noon, so the weather boost covers that).

Trout – Lake Trout, Brook, Brown, Rainbow: Cold-water active predators. Trout species remain quite active under ice (they thrive in cold water). Lake Trout in deep lakes are often targeted throughout the day; they can bite all day long, with perhaps slight peaks in morning or evening. Brook and Brown Trout (if in lakes) often cruise shallows early and late, but can also feed midday if food is present. Rainbow Trout (often stocked in ponds) commonly bite in morning and late afternoon, but also can have mid-day action, especially if it’s sunny and that triggers insect activity or meltwater (they’re weirdly sometimes more active with slight warmth). In general, trout are less strictly crepuscular than walleye – they have decent vision and energy in cold water. We will give trout a relatively flat multiplier with a mild boost at dawn and dusk. For example, trout might be 1.1× in morning and evening, and 0.9× mid-day – not a huge swing. They also can feed at night (especially lake trout will chase ciscoes at night sometimes, and browns might feed on minnows shallow at night). But trout night bite is not as universally targeted in ice fishing as walleye/crappie. We might leave a small night multiplier (~1.0 or 0.8) for trout – maybe slightly above baseline for lake trout if known to hit at night, but for simplicity, assume trout are mostly day-active with extended dawn/dusk activity. So the key is trout don’t get as penalized at noon as walleye do – they’re willing to chase a lure at 1pm if you find them.

Catfish – Channel \& Flathead: Bottom scavengers/predators, very sluggish in winter. Channel catfish can be caught through ice (for instance, in some rivers or deep holes of reservoirs, they will bite cut bait). However, their activity is low. They might have minor spurts of feeding in late afternoon or early night, but generally catfish in winter are close to dormant (especially flathead catfish, which basically hibernate in log jams until spring). For channel catfish, we’ll implement a low baseline (like bass) with maybe a small uptick in the late day or night (since catfish are traditionally nocturnal in warmer seasons, one might try at dusk or night for them even in winter). So perhaps channel cats get 0.6× most of the day, rising to 1.0× from sunset into early night, then back down overnight. Flathead catfish we could almost peg near 0 all day (they really don’t bite much in cold water). But if needed, we can say flathead share a similar curve but with an even smaller amplitude (essentially always poor, perhaps a chance of a bite in late afternoon if at all).

Sturgeon (Lake Sturgeon): Bottom feeders, cold-tolerant but slow. Sturgeon are sometimes targeted through ice (e.g., on the St. Croix or Rainy River). They cruise near bottom searching for food. Their activity isn’t strongly tied to light – it’s more about them finding food and comfortable conditions. However, many sturgeon anglers note success in low light or after dark, possibly because there’s less commotion or the fish feel safer. We can give sturgeon a slight dusk/night preference as well, but not as dramatic as walleye. Perhaps 1.1× at night, 0.9× in daytime. They also might feed during day if unbothered. So we’ll keep them relatively flat, maybe a slight boost in evening. Pressure changes might affect them less dramatically (they’re large and often deep), but they likely still respond to fronts a bit (perhaps feeding before a big front). We will use the general weather model for them but could consider their depth: if they’re in 30+ feet, remember deep fish are a bit insulated from minor pressure swings

mossyoak.com

. We might thus dampen the pressure weight for sturgeon slightly compared to shallow fish, but that can be an advanced tweak.

Cisco/Tullibee \& Burbot/Eelpout: The “other” species.

Cisco (Tullibee) are open-water plankton feeders. Under ice, they often suspend in deep water. They tend to feed during daylight when plankton rise (often midday). Anglers targeting tullibee often do well on sunny late morning or midday hours, using flashy lures to mimic plankton glints. So for cisco, we would actually make midday the peak (perhaps 1.3× around late morning/early afternoon) and low-light times less active (0.7× at night – they probably don’t feed much in darkness since they filter-feed visually). They might school and come up in water column more with some light. Overcast might reduce their feeding a bit (since less plankton movement or visibility). So they’re an example where clear, calm weather might be good for once. We’ll adjust their pattern accordingly.

Burbot (Eelpout) are actually cod-like fish that spawn in late winter under the ice, typically at night. They are notorious for a night bite, especially as February progresses. Even outside spawn, burbot are more active in the dark (they hunt other fish and invertebrates at night). We will give burbot a strong night multiplier – e.g. highest after midnight into pre-dawn. Many anglers find 9pm–midnight is prime for burbot (and also just before dawn can be good). During the day, burbot mostly sit in deeper water doing little. So maybe burbot multiplier: 0.5× daytime, rising to 1.5× by late evening/night. Also, because they spawn around the full moon (under ice), they might even feed in late winter regardless of weather, but that’s beyond our scope here. We’ll simply capture that nighttime is the right time for eelpout.

To implement time-of-day multipliers, we can create a 24-hour profile for each species (perhaps as an array of multipliers for each hour of local time). These profiles incorporate the above behaviors. For example, Walleye’s profile might look like: 4am 0.8, 5am 1.0, 6am 1.3, 7am 1.5 (sunrise peak), 8am 1.2, 9am 1.0, late morning 0.8, afternoon 0.7, then 4pm 0.8, 5pm 1.0, 6pm 1.3, 7pm 1.5 (sunset peak), 8pm 1.4, 9pm 1.2, 10pm 1.1, 11pm 1.0, etc. These are examples – the exact values can be tuned. The key is per-hour adjustments reflecting known feeding windows

fishusa.com

fishusa.com

. We will use the local sunrise/sunset times (from the weather API) to anchor these multipliers each day. For instance, if sunset is at 5:00pm, we center the evening boost around that hour (and similarly for sunrise). This ensures the forecast adapts to day length and the user’s time zone (for Minnesota, winter days are short, so dawn/dusk happen late and early respectively). Species-specific weighting of weather factors: In addition to time patterns, we will also tweak how certain weather factors affect each species:

Light-sensitive vs. sight-feeders: As noted, walleye get more benefit from clouds (they like dim light) whereas bluegill might get less benefit or even prefer some sun. We will implement this by scaling the cloud cover adjustment per species. For example, the cloud-related +5 we described is for an “average” case – for walleye/crappie/catfish we might increase that to +7, for bluegill/cisco we might decrease to +2 or even 0 if they actually prefer sun. Similarly, the clear-sky penalty of –5 might be doubled for walleye (they really hate bright light, so maybe –10 for clear midday), whereas for bluegill we set that penalty to 0 (they’re not negatively affected by clear skies as much). These can be done via species-specific coefficients on the cloud factor.

Pressure sensitivity: Nearly all fish respond to pressure changes, but fish that live very deep (like lake trout or cisco often in 50+ feet) might not feel minor barometer shifts as strongly

mossyoak.com

. Also, fish with large swim bladders (bass, walleye, pike) might feel it more. We can adjust the magnitude of pressure’s effect by species. For instance, bass and walleye might get the full ±15 point swings from pressure events, whereas lake trout or burbot (often deep) might get only ±10 from the same pressure change (since water pressure dominates at depth). Panfish might be somewhere in between. But lacking exact science, we assume a general effect for all, just noting these nuances.

Temperature sensitivity: Species like bass that hate cold might get an extra penalty if air temps are extremely cold (because that often means the water in their shallow hibernation spots is chilling further or they’re just overall sluggish). Cold-blooded sluggish species (bass, flathead catfish) basically have a ceiling on their score – even in “great” weather, they won’t hit 90+ because winter limits them. Meanwhile, trout or pike that tolerate cold can fully capitalize on good conditions. So we may cap the maximum score for some species lower. But this is more of a result of their overall behavior rather than an explicit factor. We can simply note that even if weather is perfect, a largemouth bass in January might only reach a “fair” bite score, not excellent, due to biological limits.

The time-of-day multipliers are essentially scaling factors that will be applied after summing up the weather-based adjustments. This ensures that even if weather is great, if it’s the wrong time of day for that fish, the score reflects that. Conversely, at a prime time, the score gets a boost. We will now outline how to combine everything step by step.

Combining Factors into the Final Bite Score (Step-by-Step)

Finally, we put it all together. The computation for each species at each hour would follow this logical sequence: 1. Start with Baseline 50:

Each hour’s score calculation begins at the neutral baseline of 50 (representing “average” conditions). 2. Calculate Weather-Based Adjustments:

For the given hour (and location’s forecast), evaluate each weather factor as described in Section 1 and sum up the adjustments:

Pressure/Trend: Determine current pressure relative to recent hours. Check if pressure is falling, rising, or stable. Identify if it’s in a low, normal, or high range. Assign the appropriate points (e.g., +15 for a strong fall, –10 for a sharp rise, –5 if extremely high, +5 if nicely stable in mid-range, etc.)

mossyoak.com

mossyoak.com

. Example: If at 3pm pressure is 29.75″ and 6 hours ago it was 30.10″, that’s a significant fall – maybe assign +15. If it’s 30.6″ and steady high, maybe –5 (and note how long it’s been high to adjust that penalty). Document the intermediate reasoning (this helps for debugging and possibly for explaining to users).

Cloud Cover: Note the % cloud cover at that hour. Add or subtract points per thresholds (overcast +5, clear –5, partial ~0)

fishusa.com

, then adjust for species (e.g., multiply that by species’ cloud sensitivity factor). Example: It’s overcast 90% at noon – baseline +5; if species is walleye, maybe use +7; if species is bluegill, maybe +2. If it’s 0% clear at 2pm – baseline –5; walleye might be –8, perch maybe –3.

Temperature: Look at current temp and trend. If dramatically colder than previous day or average, subtract points (cold front effect); if warming, add a few (warm front effect). Use thresholds like: temp drop > 15°F = –5 (or more), temp rise > 15°F = +5. Also, if absolute temp is extremely low (e.g. daytime high below 0°F), consider a small additional penalty (fish metabolism very slow) unless we already penalized via pressure (which we probably did, since extreme cold often pairs with high pressure). Conversely, if it’s unusually balmy (near freezing), add a bit as fish might be more active. These adjustments are modest. Example: At 6am it plunged to –20°F from yesterday’s 10°F (big cold front) – apply –7 points for extreme cold shock. At 3pm it’s 30°F after a warm trend – add +5 for warmth.

Wind: Check wind speed and gust. If gusts are high at that hour, determine if we’re on the front edge or back edge of a system. Use wind info in tandem with pressure: if pressure is falling and wind is picking up from SE, likely storm coming now – maybe give an extra +3 boost on top of pressure’s +15. If pressure is high and wind is NW at 20 mph, that’s post-front wind – maybe an extra –3 on top of pressure’s –10. If wind is mild, no additional change. Example: Forecast says wind gust 30 mph at 5pm from NW, pressure rising – that screams cold front hit -> subtract a bit more (score already low from pressure rise, but wind confirms intensity, so maybe –2 extra). Or wind 20 mph from S with falling pressure at noon -> front incoming -> maybe +2 extra to reinforce the pre-storm bite.

Precipitation: Check PoP and precip rate for the hour and surrounding hours. If PoP jumps or is high: apply the logic of pre-storm vs ongoing storm. Example: It’s 4pm and PoP goes from 40% at 3pm to 90% at 4pm, meaning snow likely starts around now. We’d already have pressure falling points, but we also add, say, +5 for the fact that right before/during onset fish are very active

fishusa.com

. If it’s been snowing for 5 hours straight at 100% PoP and now it’s 10pm, perhaps start to subtract a couple of points (fish might have slowed by now). Also consider the volume: if heavy snow of 5mm/hr is indicated, maybe shorten the “good” window and accelerate the slowdown (especially for sight feeders). If light snow, fish might keep biting through it. So possibly: during first 1–2 hours of snowfall = keep score high; after, if still snowing heavily for many hours, gradually drop 5–10 points off the score to reflect the bite tapering.

Humidity: If available, incorporate as needed. Example: If it’s 90% humidity and no rain yet, that bolsters the idea a storm is near – you might already have done so with pressure, but if pressure hasn’t dropped yet, humidity could be a leading indicator – maybe sneak in +2 anticipating a coming drop. If humidity is super low and skies clear, you likely already penalized for high pressure; humidity just confirms it (no additional needed or maybe –1 to emphasize the dry cold).

After evaluating all these, sum up all the adjustments. Let’s call this sum “weather\_score\_delta.” This delta could be positive, negative, or zero. For instance, a scenario: falling pressure +15, overcast +5, mild temps +3, wind supportive +2, precip starting +5 might sum to +30. A bad scenario: rising pressure –15, clear –5, frigid –5, windy –3 might be –28. Many times it will be moderate, e.g. +10 or –10. 3. Apply the Weather Adjustments:

Add the weather\_score\_delta to the baseline 50 to get a preliminary “weather-adjusted score.”

\\text{weather\_adjusted\_score} = 50 + \\text{weather\_score\_delta}

At this stage, we might also cap this value to ensure it stays within reasonable bounds before time-of-day scaling. For example, we might say before time adjustment, clamp it between, say, 0 and 100 (or maybe a bit narrower to leave room for time multiplier). But generally, we won’t get too far beyond those bounds because each factor was sized to avoid unrealistic totals. Example: If weather\_score\_delta was +30, then weather\_adjusted\_score = 80 (meaning extremely favorable weather conditions – many factors aligning). If delta was –28, score = 22 (very tough conditions). If delta was 0, score stays at 50 (average weather effect). 4. Apply Time-of-Day Multiplier for Species:

Now take the species’ time-of-day factor for that hour and multiply the score by this factor. The factor is essentially how active that species normally is at that hour (as we outlined in the species behaviors). This will tilt the score up or down. \\text{raw\_bite\_score} = \\text{weather\_adjusted\_score} \\times \\text{(time\\\_of\\\_day multiplier)} Using multiplication means that during peak times (>1.0 multiplier), the weather-adjusted score is boosted, and during off-times (<1.0) it’s reduced. We should be careful to avoid negative values (if weather\_adjusted\_score went negative, but realistically we’ll clamp at 0 anyway). We also ensure that 0 multiplied by anything stays 0 (if conditions are absolute zero, no fish is biting no matter the time). Alternatively, we could do an additive approach (e.g. add a fixed number of points at certain times), but a multiplier is intuitive because it naturally scales a good weather day vs a bad weather day appropriately. For instance, even in bad weather, dawn might still be a bit better than other times (so multiplier helps it not be as low relative to midday). In good weather, dawn might be off the charts good (but we cap at 100). We will use the sunrise and sunset times from the forecast to adjust the multiplier schedule each day. The multiplier arrays we design (like in species patterns above) can be anchored to those times. For simplicity, we might assume roughly the same pattern each day (and slight shifts as day length changes). 5. Cap/Normalize the Score to 0–100:

After multiplication, we enforce the score range. If any score comes out >100, set it to 100. If any goes <0 (shouldn’t really happen unless we had a big negative and a >1 multiplier for some reason), set it to 0. In most cases, scores will land in between. We also might translate those scores to qualitative ratings (like 0–30 poor, 31–60 fair, 61–80 good, 81–100 excellent, for example), but since the user specifically wants a 0–100 scale, we’ll stick to numeric output (we can always also provide a color or descriptor alongside if needed). 6. Repeat for each hour in the 5-day range:

We will do this calculation for every hour in the next 120 hours (5 days), using the forecast data (which we have interpolated to hourly). Because we interpolated the 3-hour forecast to hourly, we have values for each hour’s weather. This granular forecast allows us to catch, say, a front that comes through at 2pm Wednesday and reflect that precisely in the bite score graph. 7. Use the Full 5-Day Context:

One important aspect: we should consider the context of the whole forecast when scoring a specific hour. This means recognizing events in advance. For instance, if we see that tomorrow 6am a massive blizzard hits (pressure plummets overnight), fish might start behaving differently even at 3am or midnight before it. Our algorithm inherently does some of this by looking at pressure trend and upcoming precip, but we can explicitly smooth and anticipate: “taking into account the full 5-day forecast” implies we’re not just looking hour-to-hour in isolation, but also noticing trends over days. Concretely, we can implement a mechanism where pressure trend is computed over several hours (not just instantaneous). We can also incorporate some smoothing so that the score doesn’t jaggedly flip every hour due to minor forecast wobbles.

For example, if one model run shows a slightly different pressure by 1 mb, we don’t want the score to jump unpredictably. We can apply a mild time smoothing (like a moving average over 3 hours to the final score) to ensure gradual transitions, except when a sharp change is genuinely forecast (which we want to reflect). Essentially, ignore minute fluctuations but capture real events.

Also, if a front is coming on Day 5, fish might not be affected on Day 1–4 by it, so we wouldn’t change those scores. But if a front is Day 2, on Day 1 fish might start to behave differently the evening before (some anglers swear fish “sense a front” well in advance). To incorporate that, our pressure trend detection can look ahead several hours: e.g., if we know pressure tomorrow will drop a lot, perhaps start ramping up the score a bit in the hours before the drop actually begins. This could be done by analyzing the forecasted pressure curve rather than just instantaneous derivative.

In summary, we’ll ensure the algorithm considers a window of time around each hour for trends, rather than hyper-focusing on single-hour changes. This will produce a more stable and realistic bite forecast that still catches all the “events” (pressure drops, etc.) without excessive jitter. 8. Species-Specific Final Touches:

After the above, we have a raw score for each species per hour. We might want to apply any final species-specific normalization. For instance, as mentioned, some species simply won’t ever hit 90+ in winter. We could cap the upper limit for certain species (like largemouth bass might never exceed, say, 70 out of 100, even in great conditions, because “great” for winter bass is still just decent fishing). Conversely, for walleye or pike, if everything lines up, a 100 is conceivable (the fabled perfect storm: low pressure at sunset on a lake known for walleye). We can encode those caps or just rely on the factors naturally capping them (since bass rarely get big multipliers or big positives anyway, they likely won’t hit near 100). Also, if certain species have minimums – e.g., flathead catfish might basically live in the 0–10 range all winter – we could force that. But perhaps unnecessary; our system will likely spit out very low scores for them across the board due to low time-of-day multiplier and few positive weather influences (they don’t care if it’s a great front; they still won’t move much). 9. Output the Bite Score Matrix:

The result will be a matrix of scores: for each species (row) and each hour time step (column) over 5 days, a number 0–100. This can be visualized as a heatmap or as individual line graphs, etc., but presumably the “Bite Forecast” tab will display something like a timeline with points or bars indicating bite quality for each species. We will also produce textual explanations for users (maybe on hover) to explain why the score is high or low: e.g., “Walleye: 85/100 at 6:00pm – Excellent: Low pressure system at sunset, overcast skies – ideal feeding conditions

fishusa.com

fishusa.com

.” Or “Bluegill: 20/100 at 5:00am – Poor: middle of the night and very cold high-pressure conditions

kestrelinstruments.com

fishusa.com

.” The scoring system’s design with discrete factors makes it easy to generate such explanations by referencing which factors were positive or negative. 10. Adjust for Location (Time Zone \& Lake):

Since we will use the lake’s lat/long to get weather, the forecast is already location-specific. We just ensure we apply the local time zone (so sunrise/sunset are correct locally) for the hourly breakdown. Minnesota spans one time zone (Central) so that’s straightforward for most cases. If the user’s local time is used, we convert accordingly. But essentially, yes, we take the user’s or lake’s local time so that 6am means 6am local, etc., aligning with sunrise/sunset for that location. Also, local lake conditions (if a lake is known for clearer water vs murky) could influence how cloud cover or light matters (clear lake = more effect of light changes). Such detail is beyond our current scope but can be a future enhancement. For now, we assume an average clear/medium clarity lake.

By following the above steps, we create a comprehensive bite score system that:

Integrates multiple weather “events” (pressure changes, cloud cover, fronts, precipitation, etc.) and weights them appropriately

fishusa.com

fishusa.com

.

Sets thresholds for good/fair/poor conditions per factor (e.g. specific pressure ranges, cloud percentages, temperature changes).

Applies time-of-day multipliers to capture species-specific feeding times

fishusa.com

fishusa.com

.

Combines all factors into a final 0–100 score that can change each hour with the weather, but in a controlled, logical way (big changes only when big events happen, smaller changes for subtle shifts).

This system is built specifically for the ice-fishing season in Minnesota (winter conditions). It acknowledges that winter fish behavior is different from summer (slower metabolism, more pronounced effect of fronts)

midwestoutdoors.com

kestrelinstruments.com

. We will build a separate model for open-water season later, but many principles (pressure, time of day, etc.) will carry over with different tuning. Finally, as weather forecasts themselves update and become more accurate closer to the day, the bite forecast will automatically update. Small forecast changes shouldn’t flip the bite score too much (due to our smoothing approach), but larger changes (e.g. the storm path shifts) will appropriately reflect in the scores – and that’s fine, it means our forecast is becoming more accurate as well. We aim for the forecast to be dynamic but not wildly erratic. Over a 5-day span, expect some day-to-day changes in the predicted bite quality, especially for later days as the weather forecast uncertainty resolves – this is normal and desirable for improved accuracy. By implementing this scoring system, we can generate a detailed hour-by-hour, species-by-species “Bite Forecast” that anglers can use to plan the best times to fish a given lake, with confidence that it factors in all the crucial weather events (from a rising blizzard to a calm high-pressure freeze) that influence fish behavior
